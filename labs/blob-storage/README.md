(Name of lab)
=============
(Enter a short description of what the lab will go through here. Approximately 5-10 sentences.)

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to successfully complete this lab you need to:

* Have successfully setup your Azure Subscription, your development environment and your Tessel according to instructions outlined in the [Setup Lab](../_setup).
* (Add other prerequisites here)
* (If the lab uses features, tools or languages that are only available on certain operating systems make sure you specify them here, i.e. PowerShell, Visual Studio, C#, etc.)
* (...)

Instructions
------------
(Describe the lab here. Divide the lab into logical parts in order for the participant to easily follow along. If possible, describe the steps in the lab using steps that are platform agnostic, i.e. it should work using whatever operating system you want. If possible use Azure-CLI to manage Windows Azure, but also explain how to use the portal if you feel it adds extra value or visibility. Remember that the portal(s) are changing faster than Azure-CLI, so the labs will be easier to maintain if we use Azure-CLI and since the Tessel's programming tools are used from the console, we might as well stick with it as much as possible. The preferred programming language on the server and client side should be JavaScript if possible in order to keep complexity of setup to a minimum.)

	// Use comments in code only if code is otherwise confusing.
	// We want the code to be as good and clean written that it
	// is self-explanatory and doesn't need comments. Still don't
	// be afraid to use comments if needed.

	code.indent(tab); // Indent code with 4 spaces (or tab) to have it appear as code
